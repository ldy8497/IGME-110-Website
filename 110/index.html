					<h1>Kingdom Hearts</h1>
	      	<p>Kingdom Hearts is a series of games developed by Square Enix across a multitude of gaming devices. The series features
						 many unique Square Enix characters, as well as Final Fantasy characters (also from Square Enix), and of course, many
					 	 Disney worlds, characters, and stories.</p>
					<p>The series mostly follows the character Sora on his quest to defeat the darkness threatening all the different worlds
					   featured throughout the games. With a wide, unique cast, deep narrative themes, and many familiar Disney faces and
						 locales, Kingdom Hearts is a series that has held the attention of fans from all ages.</p>

				<h1>Existentialism</h1>
      	<p>“Thus, the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places
					 the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders,” (Sartre, 1946).</p>
				<p>Existentialism is a largely misunderstood philosophy, much the same way as Nihilism is misunderstood. This quote from
					 Jean-Paul Sartre came from a lecture of his, a lecture that was written for the sole purpose of eliminating these
				 	 misunderstandings.</p>

				<h1>Roxas</h1>
      	<p>Existentialism is very prevalent throughout certain characters' stories in Kingdom Hearts. My favorite of these characters
				   is Roxas, who first appeared in Kingdom Hearts II.</p>
				<p>Roxas as a character starts out as a blank slate in almost every sense; he exists when he shouldn't, has no idea why, has no
					 identity or personality. Narratively, it is often difficult to develop a character from this state and make them feel like
				   a plausibly real person. Tetsuya Nomura (the lead character designer) mastered this delicate area of writing with Roxas.</p>
