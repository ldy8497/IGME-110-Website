				<h1>Existential Thought</h1>
				<p>&emsp;Existentialism is a philosophy concerned with, well, existence. It began
					in the 19th century with Soren Kierkegaard, who firmly believed that each
					individual is the sole entity responsible for giving their own life a
					meaning and living it "authentically". The above picture depicts Kierkegaard
					as well as three other important existential philosophers, Fyodor Dostoyevsky,
					Jean-Paul Sartre, and Friedrich Nietzsche, who is also the most important
					figure in Nihilist thinking. Over time, existentialism grew in
					prominence, especially during and after World War II. A lot of existentialism
					deals with a struggle to come to terms with the world and the notion of your
					own mortality, but it isn't all doom and gloom. It's an effort to understand
					your own existence. There have been numerous contributions to existentialism
					since its inception, and the following are some important concepts in the philosophy
					that I find intriguing.
				</p>
				<h2>"Authenticity"</h2>
				<p>&emsp;Authenticity is closely related to another idea, facticity. To keep
					it brief, facticity involves how a person's external circumstances relate
					to/affect how they define themselves. Authenticity is basically the idea
					that you create who you are by choosing to do actions that align with your
					values and who you want to become, allowing one to take responsibility for
					their actions. Facticity comes in to play because there are some times
				  when we cannot do something in accordance with our values, or our facticity
					allows us the freedom to do what we want to be who we want.
				</p>
				<h2>"Existence Precedes Essence"</h2>
				<P>&emsp;This idea comes from Jean-Paul Sartre, a French philosopher and writer.
					The central idea here is that you are you, an individual, and not what people call you or
					what you appear to be. This notion places one directly on the helm of the ship
					of their life. Everything they are is the result of choices they have made,
					they are responsible for who they are. It holds one accountable for their
					actions, and refuses to attribute those actions to some concept like "human nature"
					or "God". A person is defined by the things they choose to do.
				</p>
				<p>&emsp;For example, consider a situation in which a person who is financially
					struggling (due to circumstances outside their control) decides to rob
					someone in an alley so they can obtain money. An existentialist would not
					see this person as a victim of circumstance; the person chose to do the robbery,
					so they are responsible for that action and its consequences. The circumstances
					that lead to the person's poverty are not to blame. They could have chosen not
					to do the robbery.
				</p>
				<h2>"The Absurd"</h2>
				<p>&emsp;This one is a bit tough, but hopefully I do it justice. "The Absurd"
					refers to the notion that the world is not inherently good or bad, and
					that anything can happen to anyone at any time. It's the idea that "bad
					things happen to good people" is false, since good and bad things happen to
					both good and bad people. The world, inherently, means nothing beyond what
					we make it mean. This is referred to as "absurd" because as humans, we
					naturally try to define things and understand things. This absurdity arises
					when what we have defined the world as is not the same as what we experience.
					As many existentialist thinkers have described in their works, this usually
					happens during tragic events. It is sadly a fact of life that bad things
					happen. Sometimes, those things are so terrible that they destroy every
					rational notion we've had of the world, life, and ourselves. That is the
					Absurd.
				</p>
				<h2>"Angst, Dread and Despair"</h2>
				<p>&emsp;One of the more... dark... parts of existentialism is the idea that
					humans naturally experience "existential anguish" during certain events,
					especially events concerning one's own death. This refers to the acknowledgement
					that one often has the capability to end their own life, an act that has
					been a central controversy to almost every single philosophy in history.
					Existentialism doesn't really take a stance on suicide, but fully supports
					the fact that, as a result of one's freedom, the act is possible.
				</p>
				<p>&emsp;Existential dread also involves the knowledge that one is responsible
					for their actions. If they choose to do an action, and something goes horribly
					wrong, they are the one to blame. Knowing that before choosing to do something
					can lead one to feel this sense of dread. The pressure of knowing your action
					and its consequences are entirely your responsibility can certainly be
					overwhelming.
				</p>
				<p>&emsp;Lastly, existentialism defines despair as a state of being when one's
					defining qualities are capable of crumbling. This state is a universal state
					experienced by almost every individual according to existentialism. One can
					be in despair (in existential terms) without feeling despair (in the traditional meaning).
					This is not to say everyone feels bad at all times; it is just the notion that,
					as we saw with absurdity, our minds depend on how we have constructed ourselves,
					and that parts of that construction are capable of being destroyed, leaving
					one feeling despair in the literal sense.
